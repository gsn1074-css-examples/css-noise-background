# css-noise-background

The project shows how to create a tv noise background with CSS.

## Development Technologies

+ CSS

## Limitations

+ Strange bug in IE11 and Edge - attribute is toggled normally, but results do not render on screen unless you open F12 tools and expand or click around inside the data-noiseBox node in the elements window - then it renders on screen as expected.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
